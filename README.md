# My personal nix setup

I'm running [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).

Most of my installed programs, packages and configuration lives in `.nix` configuration files.
I'm uploading these files here so they're persisted & when I'll need to set up a new machine, I can share configs and rebuild the environment I'm used to.
